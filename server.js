//Middleware function
const logRequest = (req, res, next) => {

    // req.originalUrl contains the original URL requested by the client.

// By using app.use(logRequest), the logRequest middleware is applied globally to all routes and methods in the application. This ensures that every request, regardless of its type or endpoint, gets logged.


//initialize passport
app.use(passport.initialize())
// The line app.use(passport.initialize()) is part of the setup process for integrating Passport.js into an Express.js application. 
// This line adds Passport.js middleware to your Express.js application.
// It initializes Passport, allowing it to be used for handling authentication requests.


const localAuthenticationMiddleware = passport.authenticate('local', { session: false });  //local is the strategy we are using in passport...To use authentaication in difffernt routes.

// In this line, we are creating a middleware using Passport's local strategy, 
// which typically refers to username and password authentication.
// The option { session: false } indicates that no session should be created 
// for the user, meaning the authentication is stateless. This is commonly  used in API token-based authentication, where each request must be independently authenticated.
// By storing the middleware in a variable, our code becomes cleaner and more organized when handling requests, as localAuthenticationMiddleware will be responsible for verifying the username and password on incoming requests.
